This project includes an AirHockey game developed using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. The main goal is to get the air hockey checker into the opponent's goal. There are easy, medium and hard levels. The end of the game may be when a certain score is reached or a certain amount of time has passed. The project is installed with Unity's standard installation procedures and can be easily run in the Unity Editor.
